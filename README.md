### 👨‍💼 About Me

👨‍💻 About me: I am a frontend developer specializing in the modern JavaScript stack with experience in web technologies including Vanilla JavaScript, React, NodeJs and TypeScript. I pride myself on having a growth mindset and, as such, I’m always looking to improve my skills. I am looking for an Agile software organization where I can use my skills to contribute while also growing as a developer.


🛠️ In 2019, motivated by genuine interest and needing a change, I embarked on my journey to learn to code with the sole goal of becoming a software developer and building a career in the tech industry. In 2021 I started my first professional job as a developer at REA and the rest is history.


🚀 Some of my favourite sayings: "Code is poetry written by programmers.", "Coding is thinking, not typing.", "The best error message is the one that never shows up."
